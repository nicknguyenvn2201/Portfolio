Conversion rate plays an important role in your digital marketing campaigns.
Whenever you run an online campaign, you can monitor your conversion rate to see how it drives results for your business.
Your conversion rate is an indicator of your campaignâ€™s success.
A good conversion rate is higher than 10%, with a small percentage of businesses obtaining 11.45% on average, while this number varies based on industry and channel. Reaching a conversion rate of 5.31% or higher can place your company among the %25, making your conversion rate twice better than the average conversion rate.

Bounce Rate is usually used in Digital Marketing and Web Traffic Analysis. It is a very important indicator that Google uses 
to measure how relevant or useful your website page is to visitors.
If the bounce rate is high, this will affect its ranking in search engines.
As a rule of thumb, a bounce rate in the range of 26 to 40 percent is excellent. 41 to 55 percent is roughly average. 56 to 70 percent is higher than average, but may not be cause for alarm depending on the website. Anything over 70 percent is disappointing for everything outside of blogs, news, events, etc.
